phpOracleAdmin - Installation and Requirements 

Unpack the tarball and modify the config.inc.php to
your system environment.

phpOracleAdmin needs php 4 with oci8 support to run 
and is only tested with Oracle 8.1.5 and upper versions.
(maybe it runs at 8.0.x at upper)

If you want to use additions session features, your php 4 
must be installed with sessionsupport and because of some 
small problems, please enable cookies at your browser. 

If you have Problems here are some hints:

make sure, that you have the complete oracle environment vars 
in the webserver environment BEFORE start the server. 
important are:

ORACLE_HOME
ORA_NLS33
NLS_LANG

also be sure, the the databasename is correct written and 
configured in the tnsnames.ora

IMPORTANT:
If you want to use additional php 4 sessionbased functions,
be sure, that the sessiondata (saved by the webserver at 
filesystem) sre not readable by others !
Databased accoutdatas were stored there. 
If you are not sure disable phpOracleAdmins session support
by setting:
$ENABLE_SESSIONS_FUNCTIONS=FALSE;
in the config.inc.php.

Usage Hint:
Because this is an webapplication, disable all objects 
that you dont need (eg. triggers if you do not have some or
you are not interested in some) this make the loading time 
shorter and saves traffic.
